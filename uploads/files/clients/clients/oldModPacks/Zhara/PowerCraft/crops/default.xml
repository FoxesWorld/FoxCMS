  BLOCK HARVESTER CONFIG FILE
  You can add your own crops into this file.
  Any other xml files in this folder will be parsed too.

  If you make a setup file for some mod, please post it on forums.

  Special values:
    metaMature  = -1  ...  any metadata
    metaReplant = -1  ...  do not replant

    Item meta   <  0  ...  get item with meta = blockMeta & abs(THIS_NUMBER) - useful for leaves

  Item meta can be ranged - use 4-7 for random meta in range 4 to 7 (inclusive).
  You can also use range for item count (eg. 0-5). 

  Higher rarity number means more rare. Use 1 for regular drops.
